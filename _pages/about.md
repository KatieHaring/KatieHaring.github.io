Welcome!

My name is Katie Haring, and I am currently a Lead Analyst at Duquesne Light Company. I have a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science, a Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Analytics, and over 9 years of experience working in analytical fields. My career has given me strong skills in data wrangling, coding, statistical modeling, data visualization, and analytical thinking. 

I started my career in actuarial roles, but quickly realized that I wanted to broaden my analytical horizons and expand my skill set. This led me to more diverse analytics roles utilizing HR and healthcare data. From there, an interest in statistical modeling led me to pursue my Masters. In May 2020, I graduated with a 4.00 GPA in less than 18 months, all while continuing to perform full-time analytics work. A full listing of the classes in my program can be found on the Education tab and some examples of the projects I worked on can be found on the Portfolio tab.

In late 2020, I joined Duquesne Light Company where I work on many types of problems. Sometimes I'm building regression, clustering, or time series models to explain and predict customer behavior. Sometimes I'm creating trainings and documentation for coding software. Other times I'm writing code to identify the story in our data, then utilizing qualititative and supplemental data sources to help explain the patterns I find therein.
