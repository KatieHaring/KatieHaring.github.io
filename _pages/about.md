Welcome!
 
My name is Katie Haring, and I am currently a Lead Analyst at Duquesne Light Company. I have a Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Analytics and over 9 years of experience working in analytical fields. My career has given me strong skills in data wrangling, coding, statistical modeling, data visualization, and analytical thinking. 

I started my career in actuarial roles, but quickly realized that I wanted to broaden my analytical horizons and expand my skill set. This led me to more diverse analytics roles utilizing HR and healthcare data, where I developed a passion for and an interest in statistical modeling, and I decided to pursue my Masters in Applied Statistics and Analytics. I graduated in May 2020 with a 4.00 GPA while continuing to perform full-time analytics work. A full listing of the classes in my program can be found on the Education tab and some examples of the projects I worked, as well as personal projects that I work on in my spare time, on can be found on the Portfolio tab.

In late 2020, I joined Duquesne Light Company where I work on all kinds of analytical problems. I write complex code to pull data using SQL, build predictive and descriptive statistical models in R, and train and mentor less tenured associates. I recently built a model that increased customer engagement with a marketing campaign by over 200% and received an Employee Excellence Award for my work in 2023.
