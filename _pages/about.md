Welcome!

My name is Katie Haring, and I am currently a Lead Analyst at Duquesne Light Company. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science in 2014 and have over 7 years of experience working in analytical fields, including actuarial science and people analytics. My career has given me strong skills in data wrangling/data management, coding, data visualization, and analytical thinking. 

However, I wanted to expand my statistical knowledge and transition to using more complex methods of modeling, so I obtained a Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Analytics in May 2020. I graduated with a 4.00 GPA in less than 18 months, all while continuing to perform full-time analytics work. A full listing of the classes in my program can be found on the Education tab and some examples of the projects I worked on can be found on the Portfolio tab.

In addition to my general data and statistical modeling interests, I have a passion for survey design and analysis and believe that qualitative data can add true value and color to traditionally-used quantitative data, particularly in the field of people analytics. I have experience using Qualtrics and Workday, and have worked extensively with data from Gallup's Q12 survey. I am committed to the idea that improvements in employee happiness and engagement are mutually beneficial to both employees and employers.
