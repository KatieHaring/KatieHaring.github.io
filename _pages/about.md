Welcome!

My name is Katie Haring, and I am currently a Lead Analyst at Duquesne Light Company. I have a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science, a Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Analytics, and over 9 years of experience working in analytical fields. My career has given me strong skills in data wrangling, coding, statistical modeling, data visualization, and analytical thinking. 

I started my career in actuarial roles, but quickly realized that I wanted to broaden my analytical horizons and expand my skill set. This led me to more diverse analytics roles utilizing HR and healthcare data. From there, an interest in statistical modeling led me to pursue my Masters. In May 2020, I graduated with a 4.00 GPA in less than 18 months, all while continuing to perform full-time analytics work. A full listing of the classes in my program can be found on the Education tab and some examples of the projects I worked on can be found on the Portfolio tab.

In addition to my general data and statistical modeling interests, I have a passion for survey design and analysis and believe that qualitative data can add true value and color to traditionally-used quantitative data, particularly in the field of people analytics. I have experience using Qualtrics and Workday, and have worked extensively with data from Gallup's Q12 survey.
