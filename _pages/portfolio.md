## [U.S. State Clustering using a SOM](https://rpubs.com/kmhst25/StateClusteringSOM)


I created a Self Organizing Map to create clusters of U.S. states (including Washington, D.C.) and determine if the standard regional groupings (Midwest, New England, etc.) are truly reflective of statesâ€™ characteristics. I created this model just to test my skills and stay sharp. It's more of a practice exercise than a comprehensive analysis.

I performed the analysis for this paper during my time at Highmark Health. The paper took a while to write, edit, and submit, so it was published after I had already left the company.
