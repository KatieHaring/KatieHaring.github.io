## R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham

<img src="/images/RforDataSci.png" width="200" height="310">

I learned R and various data science techniques through my Masters program, but I wanted to supplement my education with additional reading. So far, this book is proving useful, due to its focus on the tidyverse. My Masters education primarily focused on coding using Base R, so it's been interesting to compare and contrast the two methods.

### Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by David Robinson and Julia Silge

I had had this book for a while and had used bits and pieces of it before, but I thought it was time for a more thorough reading. I was working on a text analysis project at the time, so the timing seemed apropos.

### Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask

With deep learning becoming ever more popular, I thought it would be wise to review the information and strengthen my knowledge of the topic. The author does an amazing job of breaking complex mathematics down into simple structures and concepts. I would recommend this book to just about anyone with an interest in neural networks.

### Introductory Time Series with R by Paul S.P. Cowpertwait & Andrew V. Metcalfe

Unfortunately, time series analysis was not part of my Masters program. The University was putting together a class, but it didn't launch before I graduated. I hoped this book would fill in that gap. Not all of the information was useful for what I will probably use this topic for, but the book provided some solid, basic time series code for my code repository.

### Improving Survey Questions by Floyd J. Fowler, Jr.

It is often difficult to explain the principles of survey design to vested parties, as it is such a niche field that many people assume that there are no set principles. I picked this book up, because I want to have solid justification for the recommendations and decisions I make when it comes to surveying.
